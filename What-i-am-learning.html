                These days, I am learning about advanced technologies and how
                their applications in different fields can change the way we
                innovate, research, and operate in various industries. I follow
                advancements in AI applications, quantum computing, and virtual
                reality. There are several YouTube channels that I'm following
                regularly; Iâ€™ve added them below just in case you want to take a
                look!

              <h2>What I learned from 2021 to 2024<br /></h2>
            </header>
            <p>
              Four years ago, when I had to close my company in Iran, I realized
              I needed two things moving forward: a more stable environment, and
              a commitment to constant learning. I immigrated to Canada where I
              found this stable environment.
            </p>
            <p>
              My learning goal for the first year, 2022, was to become confident
              in my English, find my community, and feel at home in my new
              country. My goal for 2023 was to learn about Canadian work
              cultureâ€”how organizations operate, how people communicate and
              network, and the mindset of investors and entrepreneurs in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              I learned a lot in these years. I learned how accelerators operate
              and how entrepreneurship programs are funded. I experienced being
              a founder and helped other founders in their journey. I also
              learned how to communicate effectively within an academic
              organization, both in writing and in person. Considering the
              Iranian culture I grew up in, I had to "reprogram" myselfâ€”from
              being indirect and overly diplomatic (to adhere to the cultural
              norms in Iran) to being clear, direct, and concise in Canada.
              These days, I feel very comfortable with my communication skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              My learning goal for 2024 was to become proficient in managing
              large-scale programs, deepen my understanding of relationships
              with external stakeholders, and explore how partnerships and
              inter-organizational relations work. I am very happy with my
              performance in 2024. I designed and led projects that received
              high participation and positive attention from our partners. One
              of these projects became an annual program, and I also became
              involved in other exciting initiatives!
