              <h1>My Career Journey</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
              The first time I dreamed of a career, I imagined myself in a white
              dress code, working in a lab or a hospital, so I decided to study
              pharmacy, a combination of lab and hospital. In January 2014, I
              started my Doctor of Pharmacy program, believing it would be my
              lifelong path. By 2018, I had completed my internship and started
              working in a hospital as a Pharm-D intern, excited to begin my
              career.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, after three months, I realized pharmacy wasn't my true
              passion. I enjoyed the work, but it didn't light the spark I was
              looking for. While continuing in pharmacy, I started exploring
              other options, hoping to find something more adventurous.
            </p>
            <p>
              In December 2018, I took my first step into entrepreneurship. A
              friend and I started a small cosmetic business, creating
              customized herbal creams, gels, and lotions for spas and salons.
              While we had some customers, our products didn't stand out enough
              to grow the business. So, in July 2020, we shifted to marine-based
              products, focusing on spirulina and phycocyanin.
            </p>
            <p>
              This new venture came with its own challenges. Growing algae in a
              lab and scaling production turned out to be much harder than we
              expected. With limited money and resources, we couldn't keep the
              business running. By September 2020, we had to close it down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it was disappointing, this experience taught me a lot. I
              learned the importance of understanding technology deeply, doing
              honest market research, and building a strong support network.
              Most importantly, I realized how much I needed to keep learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked as a lab assistant while improving my English and
              applying to master's programs in entrepreneurship and innovation.
              In 2021, I was accepted into Toronto Metropolitan University. At
              first, I attended classes online while working full-time. In
              December 2021, I moved to Canada, ready to start a new chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transition wasn't easy. The first six months were tough as I
              adjusted to a new culture and pushed myself out of my comfort
              zone. But I kept going. Over the next 18 months, I joined TMU's
              Innovation Boost Zone, started working on a new startup, and
              gained hands-on experience. After graduating, I needed to focus on
              practical matters like getting permanent residency and building
              the foundation of my life in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              I paused my startup and took a job at TMU's Biomedical Zone,
              working with startups in the healthcare space. I discovered it is
              so joyful to work with researchers, inventors, and startups to
              help them in their startup development. I got to work with many
              cutting-edge technologies but not be overwhelmed with the stresses
              of managing a startup.
            </p>
            <p>
              While working with Biomedical Zone, I was assigned to work with
              the Systems, Software, and Semantics (LS3) Lab as consultant and
              conduct market research for some of their projects. After two
              months of working with their team, they offered me the opportunity
              to become a team member on the Codify AI project. They hired me as
              an Innovation Specialist in Bridging Divides.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was on a 6-month probation, during which I worked with Bridging
              Divides on two streams: first, as a product owner for Codify AI,
              focusing on user experience and aligning the product features with
              the stakeholdersâ€™ business strategy. Second, developing an
              innovation portfolio (innovative projects that contribute to
              innovation KPIs) for Bridging Divides. I proposed five projects,
              and three of them were funded.
            </p>
            <p>
              After the probation period, I was hired as Innovation Lead. I
              managed a team of four students, executing and managing three
              projects that I had proposed: Build a Bridge, Startup Spotlight,
              and Heritage Market Place, while allocating half of my time to
              Codify AI. In 2024, when the BMO Newcomer Workforce Integration
              Lab was initiated, I was added to their team and began my
              collaboration with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had an enjoyable experience working on the development of Codify
              AI. I learned that to continue my career in digital tools
              development, I need to learn more about the technical aspects of
              developing AI and ML products. I took a 16-week accelerated
              program at the University of Toronto, and in this program, I
              learned many new things every week. Every weekend, I would spend
              hours debugging code and applying all of my learning to practice
              and complete mini projects. I am very pleased with this intense
              learning experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I believe AI is fundamentally reshaping how industries operate,
              develop products, analyze customer data, and design strategic
              initiatives. I want to be a part of this transformation. Moving
              forward, I'm prepared to bring three key strengths to my future
              team: project management expertise, entrepreneurial thinking, and
              knowledge in data science and machine learning. I'm actively
              seeking project management positions with companies that are
              pioneers in AI adoption, where I can collaborate with teams to
              accelerate product development and contribute to AI integration in
              organizations.
