              <h1>My Career Journey</h1>
            </header>

            <p>
              The first time I dreamed of a career, I imagined myself in a white
              dress code, working in a lab or a hospital, so I decided to study
              pharmacy, a combination of lab and hospital. In January 2014, I
              started my Doctor of Pharmacy program, believing it would be my
              lifelong path. By 2018, I had completed my internship and started
              working in a hospital as a Pharm-D intern, excited to begin my
              career.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, after three months, I realized pharmacy wasn’t my true
              passion. I enjoyed the work, but it didn’t light the spark I was
              looking for. While continuing in pharmacy, I started exploring
              other options, hoping to find something more adventurous.
            </p>
            <p>
              In December 2018, I took my first step into entrepreneurship. A
              friend and I started a small cosmetic business, creating
              customized herbal creams, gels, and lotions for spas and salons.
              While we had some customers, our products didn’t stand out enough
              to grow the business. So, in July 2020, we shifted to marine-based
              products, focusing on spirulina and phycocyanin.
            </p>
            <p>
              This new venture came with its own challenges. Growing algae in a
              lab and scaling production turned out to be much harder than we
              expected. With limited money and resources, we couldn’t keep the
              business running. By September 2020, we had to close it down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Although it was disappointing, this experience taught me a lot. I
              learned the importance of understanding technology deeply, doing
              honest market research, and building a strong support network.
              Most importantly, I realized how much I needed to keep learning.
            </p>
            <p>
              I worked as a lab assistant while improving my English and
              applying to master’s programs in entrepreneurship and innovation.
              In 2021, I was accepted into Toronto Metropolitan University. At
              first, I attended classes online while working full-time. In
              December 2021, I moved to Canada, ready to start a new chapter.
            </p>
            <p>
              The transition wasn’t easy. The first six months were tough as I
              adjusted to a new culture and pushed myself out of my comfort
              zone. But I kept going. Over the next 18 months, I joined TMU’s
              Innovation Boost Zone, started working on a new startup, and
              gained hands-on experience. After graduating, I needed to focus on
              practical matters like getting permanent residency and building
              the foundation of my life in Canada.
            </p>
            <p>
              I paused my startup and took a job at TMU’s Biomedical Zone,
              working with startups in the healthcare space. I discovered it is
              so joyful to work with researchers, inventors, and startups to
              help them in their startup development. I got to work with many
              cutting-edge technologies but not be overwhelmed with the stresses
              of managing a startup.
            </p>
            <p>
              These days, I work with researchers in TMU labs to help develop
              their products. While they focus on building the technology, I
              engage with users to make sure the products align with their
              needs. I then report back to the technical team to iterate on
              their products. Another part of my role is to design educational
              programs and competitions for computer engineering students. These
              initiatives help them develop products that address important
              social challenges.
