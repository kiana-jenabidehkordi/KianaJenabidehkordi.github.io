                investigates the challenges employers face in hiring and
                integrating immigrant workers into their companies. In this
                project, we design several problem-discovery roundtables for
                enterprises to explore these challenges. After problem
                discovery, we will create a toolkit and workshops to help them
                overcome those challenges. We had our first problem-discovery
                workshop on Dec 10th, 2024.

              <p>
                Aleoband is a specialized bandage designed to treat severe
                sunburn symptoms in athletes who frequently experience sunburn.
                The bandage utilizes Aloe Vera fibres extracted through specific
                methods to create a dry fibre layer with high absorbency. This
                layer absorbs inflammatory secretions and gradually transforms
                into a gel. As the transformation is an endothermic reaction, it
                provides a cooling effect, reducing heat and inflammation while
                protecting the skin from environmental factors. The
                multi-functional bandage cools, heals, and protects the skin
                simultaneously, significantly reducing pain, itchiness, redness,
                and inflammation within a day instead of a week. The external
                waterproof layer ensures that users can continue their daily
                activities without interruption.

                  I developed and tested several versions of the Minimum Viable
                  Product (MVP) with early adopters. By engaging directly with
                  users, I collected feedback to refine the product and improve
                  its effectiveness. My role also included ensuring that the
                  product met athletes' needs while being practical and easy to

              <p>
                This Project is currently being discontinued due to personal
                reasons. I started this venture while studying Engineering
                Innovation and Entrepreneurship, but upon graduation, I needed
                to secure permanent residency to ensure my ability to stay in
                Canada. Given these priorities, I decided to pause the venture
                and consider continuing it at a more suitable time in the
                future.

                Research Project: Co-encapsulation of metformin and ginger into
                the liposomes: in vitro characterization and in vivo
                anti-psoriasis evaluation.

              </span>
              <p>
                In this study, we investigated the co-encapsulation of metformin
                and ginger in liposomes as a novel therapeutic approach for
                psoriasis treatment. We hypothesized that this combination would
                enhance drug penetration, improve therapeutic efficacy, and
                minimize systemic side effects. Metformin was selected due to
                its ability to inhibit keratinocyte proliferation and modulate
                inflammatory cytokine production through the mTOR signaling
                pathway, while ginger was incorporated for its well-documented
                anti-inflammatory properties, which help regulate immune
                responses and reduce cytokine levels.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our findings demonstrate that the co-administration of metformin
                and ginger loaded in liposomes effectively treated psoriatic
                lesions after 21 days of treatment and significantly decreased
                IL-22 and TNF-α levels compared to untreated skin and skin
                treated with betamethasone as a positive control. In conclusion,
                metformin and ginger encapsulated in liposomes have shown
                promising results in providing an effective treatment for
                psoriasis.
              </p>
              <p>
                The research was conducted in multiple phases to evaluate the
                effectiveness of metformin and ginger co-encapsulated in
                liposomes for psoriasis treatment.

                  <h4>Phase 1: Formulation and Optimization</h4>
                  <p>
                    In this phase, liposomal formulations were prepared using
                    the thin-film hydration method. Various formulations were
                    tested to optimize particle size, entrapment efficiency, and
                    drug release profiles. The goal was to develop a stable
                    liposomal formulation capable of effectively delivering
                    metformin and ginger to the skin.

                  <p>
                    The optimized liposomal formulation was analyzed for
                    particle size, drug loading efficiency, thermal behavior
                    using Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC), and drug
                    release patterns through in vitro diffusion studies. This
                    phase ensured that the formulation met stability and drug
                    release criteria for effective topical application.

                  </h4>
                  <p>
                    The permeability and retention of metformin and ginger in
                    both normal and psoriatic skin were tested using excised
                    mouse skin. The goal was to determine how well the liposomal
                    formulation penetrated the skin and whether it improved drug
                    localization compared to conventional formulations.

                  <p>
                    A psoriasis-like skin condition was induced in mice using
                    Imiquimod (IMQ) cream. The mice were then treated with
                    different liposomal formulations, and the treatment efficacy
                    was evaluated through PASI scoring, histological analysis,
                    and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) for
                    inflammatory markers (IL-22 and TNF-α). The objective was to
                    assess whether the liposomal formulation could effectively
                    reduce psoriasis symptoms.

                  <h4>Phase 5: Conclusion and Evaluation</h4>
                  <p>
                    The results were analyzed, showing that co-administration of
                    metformin and ginger in liposomes significantly improved
                    psoriasis treatment by reducing inflammation and restoring
                    normal skin structure. The study concluded that liposomal
                    drug delivery enhances treatment effectiveness and provides
                    a promising alternative to conventional psoriasis therapies.

                My co-founder and I started collaborating in December 2018. We
                were both working on our thesis research projects in the same
                lab and decided to develop a start up together. In the first
                year of our collaboration, we explored different ideas to
                develop products, showcase them to potential customers, and see
                if they are interested in purchasing them. After many trials, we
                finally created products that attracted customer interest. We
                incorporated the company in January 2020. Our mission was to
                produce herbal and marine-based anti-inflammatory dermal gels
                and creams for beauty salons.
              </p>

              <p>
                We started by producing herbal hydrogel, and since our products
                were categorized as cosmetics, we were able to sell them to
                beauty salons without going through regulatory processes. At
                this point, our business model was B2B, and we secured several
                returning customers. Our advantage over competitors was our low
                pricing and the ability to customize products for our clients
                based on their needs and the feedback they received from their
                customers. We were able to offer competitive pricing because we
                had low production costs, as we were incubated in Chamran
                University's growth center and had access to lab facilities for
                free.
              </p>

              <p>
                As we tried to expand our market, we realized that scaling up
                meant we could no longer maintain our low pricing. When we
                increased our prices, we lost most of our customers. This made
                us realize that we needed a stronger competitive advantage. To
                address this, we started developing a new line of marine-based
                products. Two of our successful products were spirulina and
                phycocyanin hydrogels. We secured customers for these new
                products and were able to generate enough revenue to cover our
                R&D costs. However, we faced many challenges in scaling up algae
                cultivation and maintaining sustainable product production.
              </p>

              <p>
                Finally, in Dec 2020, we decided to stop production and exit the
                Chamran accelerator. In April 2024, we officially discontinued
                the company, and I moved to Canada to study Engineering
                Innovation and Entrepreneurship (MEIE). My goal was to develop
                the skills needed as a startup founder and learn from other
                founders instead of diving in headfirst and learning through
                trial and error.
              </p>

              <p>
                In our startup, we were a team of two. Mostafa Khaledi, my
                co-founder and I handled product development, sales and all
                other things. We both learned a lot from our startup journey.
                Looking back, we have so many funny and beautiful memories of
                working on our passion, along with many lessons learned—some of
                them painful but valuable. 😊
