				<p>	
				is a six-week initiative designed to inspire and
                empower students to identify challenges in migrant integration
                and develop innovative AI solutions to address them. This
                initiative is hosted by the CERC in Migration and Integration
                and the Bridging Divides programs at TMU. The Responsible
                Artificial Intelligence (RAI) lab sponsors the competition
                award.

                <li>
                  I designed this program to align with the research and
                  innovation portfolio of the Bridging Divides research
                  department.
                </li>

                <li>
                  I mentored the teams in building their minimum viable product,
                  market research, customer discovery, and user tests.

              <h3>Next step for the project</h3>
              <p>
                We have decided to run the Build a Bridge program annually and
                will expand the next cohort to include four universities:
                Toronto Metropolitan University, Concordia University, the
                University of Alberta, and the University of British Columbia.
                Planning is currently underway for the next cohort, which is
                scheduled to take place in Fall 2025.

				<p>
				investigates the challenges employers face in
                hiring and integrating immigrant workers into their companies.
                In this project, we design several problem-discovery roundtables
                for enterprises to explore these challenges. After problem
                discovery, we will create a toolkit and workshops to help them
                overcome those challenges. We had our first problem-discovery
                workshop on Dec 10th, 2024.

              <h3>My Role in the Project</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I delivered a brief presentation on how AI adoption can
                  support hiring and the integration of immigrants.
                </li>

                <li>
                  I explained the questions in the roundtable instruction
                  regarding the challenges they face in deciding to implement
                  AI, applying it effectively, and educating their staff on its
                  ethical and safe use.
                </li>
                <li>
                  I facilitated one of the discussion groups, guiding the
                  conversation by asking questions and ensuring the discussion
                  remained focused on the session’s objectives. I also
                  encouraged active participation from all group members.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At the workshop's conclusion, I presented a summary of my
                  team’s discussion, sharing their feedback and ideas with all
                  participants.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>Next step for the project</h3>
              <p>
                In the first problem-discovery roundtable, 32 organizations
                participated. We plan to publish the results of this initial
                workshop, host another problem-discovery session in Spring 2025,
                and engage more employers in the project.

				<p>
				aims to gather information on social ventures and
                advanced technologies that tackle immigration and integration
                challenges. By raising awareness about the ways that technology
                can address these issues, we hope to encourage researchers to
                collaborate with these startups or take action and develop
                startups to address the immigration integration challenges.

              <p>
                Codify is a data management digital tool for qualitative
                research. It is designed for researchers in social sciences to
                label and manage their research data and is currently in the
                user test stage with Bridging Divides researchers. This project
                is being developed by the Laboratory for Systems, Software, and
                Semantics (LS3) at TMU, and Ebrahim Bagheri, Canada Research
                Chair in Social Information Retrieval, leads this project.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  I conduct user tests and work closely with the engineers in
                  the team to help them navigate the user behavior in the
                  platform, develop a user-friendly product, and achieve product
                  market fit.

                the product, I will stay in touch with researchers, conduct user
                testing, present the project at several meetings and seminars,
                and encourage more researchers to participate in user tests and
